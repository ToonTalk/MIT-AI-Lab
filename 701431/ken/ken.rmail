That LSPSFA file has moved again. It now lives on MC:TURNIP; -- it is
likely to stay there for a while. Lemme know how things go with it. I
sent in the LINEL bug to Bug-Lisp -- hope they get it fixed.

I've been travelling around the world and just got back and got your message

    I'm teaching the AI course at Stanford this quarter, and I need
    a good paper on the representation of time.  I thought of your
    masters thesis, but it's pretty long.  Isthere anything shorter?
    Other good references  Larry Fagan has just completed a PHD on
    the subject here.  I don't know anything about it yet though.
    What about a reference (paper) on your aesthetics stuff?  I'm more
    interested in technique at the monet than philosophy.

    How are things going?
    -------

I'll send a longer message later.
Gorry and I wrote a AI Journal paper on time August 1977 that I would recommend.
As to aesthetics stuff my thesis (tr should be out now or soon) is the best bet.

The trip was great!

dlist doesn't work right if dtsf is not 1.0
won't find the center etc.  Must be because I don't use it in the
stats gathered up

so use the part/whole and dependency stuff in diagrm 
then worry about making them a bit smarter
also should be able to move a link which will move the boxes at the ends
maybe the copy-of-state should be in text along with copy-of-text?

one way of fixing crossing is to allow them but change the label-position
