This file is contains useful numbers when filming either tvs, color, 2500s, logo
displays, etc.

Knight TV
Comment: it may be fairly critical how the monitor is adjusted. For stuff
with Bolex I set it at full contrast and what appears as reasonable brightness.

film type 4-x reversal (asa 400 daylight), camera Bolex, single framed,
shutter speed 12fps (equivalent to 1/40 second exposure)

 f/1.9 white on black is acceptable

 f/1.9 black on white is overexposed (unless of course it is a very dense picture)
Ken suggests for black on white f/2.8 or use tri-x but haven't tried it yet
----------------
film type 4-x negative (asa 500 daylight), camera Bolex, single framed
(monitor again full contrast and reasonable brightness (as bright as possible without
seeing "horizontal lines"

f/1.9 black on white (tv, not image on film) not bad but a little grey
f/1.9 white on black pretty good, but not well tested

f/2.8 black on white good
f/2.8 white on black even better
f/2.8 50-50 not bad

f/4.0 black on white, black looks sorta grey
f/4.0 white on black, better

f/5.6 black on white --- black is too grey (underexposed)
----------------
film type Extachrome EF (asa 160?), camera Ariflex, single framed using animation
motor (was told it was .25 second exposure) f/??? reasonable ...

----------------------------------------------------------------
2500 

film type 4-x (asa 400), camera Bolex

f/1.9 punching clear images, slightly over-exposed, no flicker
f/1.9 12 fps flickers much as 2500 does
f/4.0 punching slightly dim
f/4.0 12 fps too dim
f/1.9 24 fps so so, a little dim and refreshes

Textronics

Film type: Extrachrome ECO (Tungsten 25 asa) 
Camera: Bolex with animation motor (either 1/3 second or .3 seconds)
Black Background:  f/1.9 (I think) adequate
Red Background: f/4.0 fine

Film type: Extrachrome EF (Daylight 160? asa)
Camera: Ariflex with motor (.25 seconds)
Background: ...

if i remember right, i've done fine at f/4 with eco (no filter) at 1.5 seconds
with dark backgrounds (thou less time might have won even better since colors were
slightly washed out) 

ef b (tungsten 125 asa) 1/40 second bolex single frame 1.9 - 2.5 pretty good 
(thou video bars usually there)

ef a (daylight 160) 1/40 sec 2.0 -2.8 pretty good

----------------------------------------------------------------
Logo displays

Film type: 4-x (asa 400)

f/1.9 12 fps over exposed
f/2.8 12 fps good
f/4.0 12 fps ok
