hello, Ken;
I had a chat with John Ciampa recently in NYC, he is interested
in video-disc and computer applications, and I think
he had a need for your Director language.
He is running a symposium in late May, but I suppose
you wont even see this til then. If you do, his number
is 212-864-1415. You may want to give him a call anyway.
Regards, Paul
