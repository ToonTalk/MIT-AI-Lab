remember to put yourself back on lots of mailing lists such as
bug-lisp, bug-lispm, bug-zwei, info-lispm, lsc.

dlist doesn't work right if dtsf is not 1.0
won't find the center etc.  Must be because I don't use it in the
stats gathered up

From: DOYLE at MIT-AI (Jon Doyle)
Subject: ZWEI initialization functions
To: INFO-LISPM at MIT-AI

I got annoyed with the habit of ZWEI of starting up with an initial buffer
with package USER and a random directory in the filename.  Thus, my init
file DOYLE;LISPM > contains two functions, SET-INITIAL-FILENAME-DEFAULT,
which takes a filename (e.g. "FOO > DOYLE; AI:") and makes it the initial
default filename, and SET-INITIAL-PACKAGE-DEFAULT, which takes a package
name and makes that the package initially seen in ZWEI.  The latter function
hacks a slot in an obscure ZWEI data structure, so I hope that it can be
made a standard function to avoid lossage in the future if the implementation
of the editor changes.  I wish that LOGIN automatically called the first
function, since it only depends on the user's login name, typically.

Thanks for the abstract. Syntactic bug in last sentence. Looks good 
and nicely fits in the topic of the book. 
By the way- Borning will submit a paper - and A. Kay will submit a contribution
on Smalltalk if he feels there is not too much conflict with the Smalltalk book...

so use the part/whole and dependency stuff in diagrm 
then worry about making them a bit smarter
also should be able to move a link which will move the boxes at the ends
maybe the copy-of-state should be in text along with copy-of-text?

one way of fixing crossing is to allow them but change the label-position

The camera is running after a fashion.  One problem,however, is that the TYOWAIT command
no longer exists in logo, so it will be hard to coordinate the camera with the screen.  Is it possible to get TYOWAIT reinstated?  Also, I wrote a small amount of documentation on logo of
the hardware; you can get it by saying READ [1; USERS STEVE.P COLOR>] .
