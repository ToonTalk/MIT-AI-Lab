Subject:  delegation vs. referral
To: BEPPE at MIT-AI, HENRY at MIT-AI, KEN at MIT-AI
cc: HEWITT at MIT-AI

After kicking around the terminology
with people for a while, I have not detected
any great groundswell of support for
using "refer" instead of "delegate".

However we should emphasize more that the first
delegation is special because the client remains
the same by default through successive delegations.

Do any of you fell strongly about the question?

Cheers,

Carl

The datacomputer no longer exists, as of a few months ago.  Maybe the messages
about that came out after you left for Sweden.

	I am looking for a double or queen size bed at a reasonable price.
If you have one that you are trying to unload, or your uncle is in the bed
business and can give me an incredible deal (A deal I wouldn't give my own
mother, but for you...) please leave a message for me.Mark Sylvester (MFS @ MC)

That LSPSFA file has moved again. It now lives on MC:TURNIP; -- it is
likely to stay there for a while. Lemme know how things go with it. I
sent in the LINEL bug to Bug-Lisp -- hope they get it fixed.

dlist doesn't work right if dtsf is not 1.0
won't find the center etc.  Must be because I don't use it in the
stats gathered up

    I'm teaching the AI course at Stanford this quarter, and I need
    a good paper on the representation of time.  I thought of your
    masters thesis, but it's pretty long.  Isthere anything shorter?
    Other good references  Larry Fagan has just completed a PHD on
    the subject here.  I don't know anything about it yet though.
    What about a reference (paper) on your aesthetics stuff?  I'm more
    interested in technique at the monet than philosophy.

    How are things going?
    -------

I'll send a longer message later.
Gorry and I wrote a AI Journal paper on time August 1977 that I would recommend.
As to aesthetics stuff my thesis (tr should be out now or soon) is the best bet.

The trip was great!

so use the part/whole and dependency stuff in diagrm 
then worry about making them a bit smarter
also should be able to move a link which will move the boxes at the ends
maybe the copy-of-state should be in text along with copy-of-text?

one way of fixing crossing is to allow them but change the label-position
