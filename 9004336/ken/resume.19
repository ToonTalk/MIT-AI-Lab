	From 1973 to 1975 I implemented two versions of a time specialist, a computer
program capable of accepting a wide range of temporal statements, checking their
consistency, and making inferences to answer questions.  Following that I implemented
in Logo several small systems used by elementary school children for programming animation
and natural language.  Since then I have been involved in the design, implementation, and use
of a actor-based computer language called "Director"
for use in programming knowledge-oriented computer animation.
Concurrently I have been working on my thesis project involving the
creation a system capable of making
simple computer animated films in response to vague incomplete story descriptions.
