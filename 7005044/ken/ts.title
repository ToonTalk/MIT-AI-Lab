ABSTRACT
.begin indent 10,10,10;single space
The importance that an understanding of time plays
in many problem-solving situations requires that intelligent
programs be equipped with extensive temporal knowledge.
This paper discusses one route to that goal, namely the
construction of a time specialist, a program
knowledgable about time in general which can be used by
a higher level program to deal with
the temporal aspects of its problem-solving.
Some examples are given of
such a use of a time specialist.
The principal issues addressed in this
paper are how the time specialist organizes
statements involving temporal references,
checks them for consistency,
and uses them in answering questions.
