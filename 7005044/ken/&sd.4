	I was hungry.  So when Joe and Alice sat down to join me in the Lab's
cafeteria for lunch, I only nodded, smiled slightly, and continued to eat
my cheese and tomato sandwich.  My teeth were having a little difficulty
seperating a bite of a tomato slice from the rest, when I heard Alice ask me,
"Say, Barson, did you hear the latest deal the Space people are putting together?"
	I had always tried to keep up with what the Space Group were up to, but
I knew of no new happenings.  I put down the rest of my sandwich and as I looked
up to see Alice's large brown eyes, I said, "No, what's it all about?"
	"They are just finishing a proposal for a massive inter-stellar expedition,"
she began and then stuffed a Swedish meatball into her mouth.  Still chewing she
continued, "the plan is to have a community of ships travel a few months aparts.
Each ship is supposed to be a small self-contained community of about twenty or
thirty people and at least that many AIs. They..." she paused to stab another meatball
with her fork, long enough for me to get impatient to hear more and long enough
for Joe to add, "They are hoping for about five percent of the energy-resource pool,
but if you ask me, those resource could be better spent inside this solar system--"
	Alice and I both interupted him with a "aw c'mon", 
but he continued undaunted, "five
percent is alot and what good will it do, you both know that any returns from
such a mission would not be for hundreds of years."
	But I had stopped listening, I had heard it before, many times, too many
times, and was starting to think of the lucky devils that will go, having no
doubts that the proposal would become fact.  Alice must of have been thinking
the same thing when she said, "You know, Barson, the only job they list as
essential to the mantience of the mission is AI shrink, all the others are listed
as necessary for the human's welfare and community.  I'm thinking I might apply.
What the heck?  Why don't you apply, too?"
	"Well, there's Lilly, she probably wouldn't want to go, and Georgie he's
just started school this year.  But you know I really would want to go."
	She was cutting her last meatball with her fork when she said, "Well,
take them along."

	I sliced a hemisphere of onions, turned the slices and then cut them all
in half.  I looked across the kitchen table at Lilly who was adding yogurt to
what was to become salad dressing.  I said, "I was hearing today about this new
proposal the Space Group is putting together."  Her head remained bent towards the
bowl but her green eyes were streching upward towards me.  As I sauted the onion
slices in butter I told her of the conversation I had had at lunch with Joe and Alice.
	When I had finished, she was stirring the salad dressing and asked,
"And I suppose that you want to go and you expect to take me and Johnie along, huh?"
	That was what I hoped but I had no good idea as to how to convince her.
I started, "But don't you have any desire to be in a space ship and travel towards
unknown stars?"  I knew it sounded corny, and I knew that she really didn't have
such a desire, but that was my question.
	"Well, no really.  I mean if the environment within each ship was to my
liking I might want to go, but..."  Then she yelled down the hall, "Johnie, dinner time,
wash your hands and come in here."
	I was saying, "From what little I know about it, the societies within each
ship will be sort of utopian.  Small communities of carefully selected families and
individuals from the best, all united in a single mission ---- exploring outer space,"
as Johnie came into the kitchen.  
	He asked, "Who's going into outer space, huh, Dad?"
	I told him that some people were thinking of going to other stars.  He said 
excitedly,  "Are we going?  Huh, Dad?  Are we?"
	"Maybe, we'll see."
	As he said, "I sure hope so, that'de be fun," Lilly looked worried.
	"Pass the salad," she said.
