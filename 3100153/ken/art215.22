.sec An Introduction to the Catalonian Chapel
	This paper shall describe the fresco from the main apse of the Church
of Santa Maria de Mur.<foot Much of the information for this paper came from
an article called "A Catalonian Fresco of the Twelfth Century", Museum of Fine
Arts Bulletin, Vol. XXI, No. 125, pp 31-40, June 1923, by C. H. H..  Unless
noted otherwise all facts that are not the result of direct observation are from
that article.>
The artist is unknown, however, it is clear from studying
the work that he was strongly influenced by the Byzantine style.  It was probably
painted in the middle of the twelfth century, and certainly before 1069, the year
the Church of Santa Maria de Mur was built.  This romanesque
church is located on the southern
side of the Eastern Pyrenees in the hills of Catalonia.  The fresco was acquired
by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1921.  
	The main apse of the church is in the shape of half a cylinder with a domed
top.  It is at least twenty feet high and there are three small windows about half-way
up.  
The mural is not technically a true fresco which would be painted upon wet plaster.
It is what is called a [fi]fresco secco[fr] which is painted upon a dry prepared
tempera surface.  The paint which was apparently based on egg yolks was limited to
only a few colors, clay red, ochre, cobalt and black.  
	The fresco of the main apse is the best preserved of all the
churches in the region.  The lower part was damaged, presumably by dampness and
closeness to the ground.  The lower part of the upper panel was damaged in the
seventeenth century when a baroque altar was constructed in front of it, and
two beams were driven into the fresco.  It is believed that the colors are well
preserved and are as bright as when they were applied.
	One last technical point needs to made before preceding with the formal
analysis.  The lighting currently illuminating the mural is electric and even.
Presumably the mural was painted to be illuminated by candles and torches.  The
flickering, uneven, yellowish light must have created a significantly different
visual experience than one perceives today.
.sec A Formal Analysis of the Mural
	The fresco consists of three panels separated by geometrical bands.  The upper
portion is itself divided into a large central almond-shaped region and two smaller
regions on each side of it.  The central region of the upper panel is dominated by
an image of Christ in Majesty.  A symbol of an evangelist fills each of the other four
regions.  The middle panel depicts the twelve disciples 
and is broken into four regions by three windows.  Both sides of the windows are filled
with scenes based upon the Old Testament.  The bottom panel, parts of which are
badly damaged, depicts the Nativity Cycle.
.subsec The central region of the upper panel
	The central region of the top panel is delineated by two arcs.  Each arc consists
of wavy dark blue, blue and brown lines which presumably represent an aureole around 
Christ.  Christ nearly fills the entire region and the tips of his feet and his right
hand extend out enough to obscure a little of the aureole.  
He is depicted sitting on a cushion.
	At this point it is interesting to refer to Revelations, Chapter 4, verses 2 and 3,
which describe the day of judgement,  "... a throne was set in heaven and [fi]one[fr]
sat on the throne" and "... and there was a rainbow around the throne..."  There is
little question that this chapter of Revelations is being depicted since there are
strong correspondences between other parts of the upper panel and other verses.  This
raises the question as to whether the wavy blue, dark blue and brown lines is meant 
to represent radiant light emanating from Christ or this rainbow refered to in
Revelations.  Considering the limited palette the artist was working with, the 
non-spectral quality of the colors of the wavy lines is not strong enough evidence
to rule out the interpretation as a rainbow.
	Christ is facing directly forward.  His right arm is raised and is 
in the sign of blessing.  Upon his left thigh is a book being held by his left
hand.  The book is open, and each page is divided into five regions.  A perspective
reading of the book is very confusing, perhaps because the shape of the pages was
influenced more by the need to make the words legible than to create 
a more realistic portrayal.
The text is [fi]"Ego sum via veritas et vita, Nemo venit ad patrem nisi per me"[fr]
or "I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one cometh unto the Father, but by me."
	Christ is dressed in a light orange robe, which is heavily draped.  On top
of that robe is a shorter blue robe.  The blue robe has a gold border and a gold belt.
The blue robe is also decorated with small white flower-like designs.  The lower part
of the robe is nearly symmetrical. The lower part of Christ's legs seem very large
and to stand out from the wall.
Christ's feet can be seen protruding from the robe
onto a small cushion or foot stool.  The feet are drawn from an aerial perspective
despite the fact that the rest of his body is depicted frontally.
	The head of Christ has simple, strong features.  His eyes are very big, wide-open.
They seemed to stare down and probably strongly affected worshippers who looked up from
the base of the apse to see Christ staring down directly upon them.  Blue areas can be
seen under the eyes, on the sides of the mouth, and on the forehead.  Christ is shown
with a full beard and yet no mustache.  His small ears seem odd, sticking out from his 
hair about the level of his eyes.  Behind his head is a orange, yellow and blue halo,
which, while not in perspective, is distorted from the circular form of the other haloes
in the fresco.
All his features have a heavy dark outline and there
is little tonal variation, giving
the image an almost cartoon-like appearance.
	The only other images in the central region are of stars.  There are twelve
of them altogether.  Each star consists of eight raindrop shapes radiating from a
separated circle.  A dark border defines the edge of these shapes.  At the end of
each "drop" are three short arcs which define three concentric circles of dashed lines.
The only variation between these stars seems to be their size.  Their distribution seems
to serve no other function than to fill empty space, there is no discernible pattern.  The
number of stars, twelve, is not easily explained.  Revelations refers to seven stars, so
perhaps the stars serve no iconographic function and instead serve simply to place Christ in
heaven.
.subsec The four smaller regions of the upper panel
	Sedulius, who lived [fi]circa[fr] 450, wrote a poem called [fi]"Carmen Paschale"[fr]
a portion of which may be translated as follows:
.begin preface 0
.nofill single space skip
Matthew, treating of this in a general way, pictures the man.
Mark roars as the loud voice of a lion through desert places.
Luke maintains the rites of a priest under the guise of a young bullock.
John, flying after the manner of an eagle, seeks the heavens in his writings.
.end
	These became the accepted symbols of the four evangelists. The poem is
inscribed on the upper panel and 
the artist of the Catalonian fresco used these symbols.  These images are also referred to in 
Revelations, Chapter 4, verses 6, 7 and 8, "... were four beasts full of eyes before
and behind," "... and the first was like a lion, and the second like a calf, and the
third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle," and
"the four beasts had each of them six wings about him ..."  
	The four evangelists are each holding a book and looking at Christ.  There are four
portions of the fresco, one for each of the evangelists, each one 
is delineated by the wavy lines surrounding Christ and by horizontal
orange and blue wavy lines.  Behind each evangelist's head can be seen 
a gold circular halo surrounded by a dark heavy line.  They all have wings, the wing
closest to Christ is straight while the other wing of each of the evangelists is bent,
perhaps only to conform to the shape of the dome of the apse.
	The upper two symbols, Matthew, the winged man on the left, and John, the eagle,
on the right, are both depicted in a half profile towards their left.  Their heads, however,
are seen facing towards the center, towards Christ.  Both are blue, orange and brown
and yet the colors are applied to different parts of their respective bodies.
The correspondence between Mark, the lion,
and Luke, the bull, is even more pronounced.  Both are shown in full profile facing away
from the center, while their heads are turned completely around to face Christ.  Mark, on
the left, has his right wing bent and his left is pointing straight towards Christ, while
the opposite is true of Luke.  Both hold their book between their front legs.   Mark's body
is blue and his hind leg is orange, again the opposite is true of Luke.  While the
symmetry between the form defined by the lion and the bull is strong, the lion, Mark, differs
from the other three by having a striking facial expression.  While 
the others appear very calm, Mark
has his mouth open in surprise and perhaps fear.
	In addition, to the four evangelistic symbols, there were seven smoking pots in
the upper panel.  Only six still remain, however, the smoke from the seventh leaves little
doubt that it once existed. Once more an image from Revelations Chapter 4 appears in the
upper panel.  Verse 3 is "... and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne."
Indeed these smoking pots are around the image of Christ on the throne.  Rising above each
of the pots can be seen
three wavy lines of smoke slowly coming to a point.  As with the stars, the
artist seems to paint repeated images in a very consistent manner.
	Stars appear also in these four portions of the upper panel.  At least three
can be seen and again their significance is unclear.
.subsec The Twelve Apostles
	The middle band displays the twelve apostles in four groups, four on each extreme
and two groups of two near the middle.  While there are differences in their hair, beards,
and clothes the twelve disciples differ little in appearance.  They all seem very calm,
and are depicted in the same style as Christ.  They have large wide-open eyes, dark lines
displaying their features, and coloration to emphasize certain regions.  They all hold
books in the hands.  Near each apostle is written his name.
Within each group they stand so close there is a little overlap.
	On the left we find James (the less) with Philip.  They are looking at each
other, perhaps conversing.  James, on the left, is holding a book in his right hand, while
Philip is holding his in his left.  Their arms closest to each other are both raised
and are parallel.  James has a beard, Philip does not.  This pattern of beard alternating
with beardless faces repeats in both groups of apostles on the far right and left.
They both have orange robes underneath,
while James has a brown robe on top, and Philip's outer robe is blue.  One interesting
aspect of these two is their halos.  Both halos are gold color with black rim around them.
The other apostles alternate halo color, gold then blue then gold again.  None of the other
halos have black borders.  Why such a strong pattern would be broken by the color of James'
halo is not clear.  Perhaps the artist began on the left and only after painting the first two
halos decided to alternate colors.
	The next two apostles on the leftmost portion of the middle panel are Simon and Judas.
Except for the color of their halos the pair is similar to James and Philip.  They regard each
other with calm expressions.  They hold books with the arm farthest from the other and the
other arms are raised and parallel.  Simon, on the left, has beard. Judas does not.  They
differ from the pair on their right in that Simon's halo is blue and he is dressed in a dark
red robe while Judas is in blue.
	After the window on the left, we can see Bartholomew and Paul.  Here the pattern
changes and repeats for the next pair, and then the original pattern returns with the last
four apostles.  Instead of looking at each other, Bartholomew and Paul look directly forward.
Bartholomew, on the left, has both his hands on his book, while Paul has his right palm
facing outward.  The earlier color pattern does continue, with Bartholomew in orange and red
and Paul in blue and brown.  The halo color pattern continues with Bartholomew in front of
a blue halo and Paul a gold one.  For the most part there is little variation in the character
of the apostles, however, Paul does seem older than the others, he is balding and has a full
beard.
	Just to the right of the center window is Peter and Andrew.  They too are facing
directly forward.  Peter, on the left, is holding his book in his left hand and is giving
the same sign of blessing with his right hand as Christ is doing in the upper panel.  Peter
has a large white key hanging from a finger of his left hand
and has a full white beard.  Andrew is
distinguished by being the only one to be holding his book open.
	The next four from left to right are James (the elder), John, Thomas and Matthew.
James and John are looking at each other, as are Thomas and Matthew.  The alternation
of halo color continues, blue, gold, blue and then gold.  Similarly the beards alternate,
beard, no beard, beard and no beard.  The left member of each pair also is wearing robes
that are predominately orange or red, while the others are blue and brown.  The previous
patterns with the arms is broken here with James' left arm being up, John's right palm
directed outward, Thomas' right hand in sign of blessing and Matthew's left palm out.
.subsec The Three Windows of the Middle Panel
	The jambs of the three windows are decorated with episodes from the book of
Genesis.  The canopy of each window is decorated with a design intended to give the
appearance of fans.  The left and right fans are two shades of blue with a brown edge.
They are against a black background that is decorated with eight with flower-like patterns
that we can also see on Christ's robe and on the divider between the middle and lower panels.
The central fan is more elaborate and is blue, light orange, 
and dark orange.  All these fans give
a strong feeling of depth.  Pilgrims who travelled through Syria are believed to have
originated the custom of decorating churches with such fans.
In Syria, painted palm leaves were made into fans and sold
as souvenirs to pilgrims.  These were then often given as gifts to the churches when the
pilgrims returned.
.subsubsec The Left Window Jamb
	On each side of the window one can see a youth with outstretched arms holding the
edge of the fan.  They are both dressed in blue, the one on the left wearing blue
stockings the other red ones.  There is a star on the far side on each of their waists.  
They have their heads turned, facing outward.  They are almost mirror images of each other.
It has been suggested that they are Upholders of the Universe.  In any case, it is likely
that they represent some aspect of Genesis since the other two jambs definitely do.
.subsubsec The Middle Window Jamb
	The middle jamb depicts Cain and Abel; Cain, on the left side of the window, is
holding a lamb in offering while Abel, on the other side, is holding a growing plant in
a pot.  Cain has brown hair, is beardless, and is dressed in red.  He is holding two
legs of the lamb in each hand.  Abel is also beardless, he is dressed in orange robes
and has reddish hair.  His arms are outstretched holding the pot.  Both are facing the
center window.  
	There is one very perplexing aspect of the center jamb.  On the right, above
Abel, the farmer with his plant, is written very clearly "Chain."  Now in the MFA Bulletin
is written, "On the window embrasures appear the names Abel and Cain, the latter spelt,
according to the Spanish, with an h."<foot [fi]Op. cit.[fr] p. 38>  There is no sign
of any writing on the side where Cain is depicted, and only the word "Chain" appears
on the side where Abel stands.
Perhaps the author was refering to the writing on the right jamb which has Abel's name
near him and
the letters "CH" near Cain.  Why is the name of Cain written right
next to the image of Abel, with no writing on the other side?  The identities of the
characters is certain, besides the nature of their offerings (Cain a lamb and Abel a plant)
the brothers appear again on the next jamb which depicts the first murder.
.subsubsec The Right Window Jamb
	The left part of the rightmost window jamb displays Cain killing Abel.  Abel is
crouched down, his eyes are closed, mouth open, hands outstretched
and is being hit on the head.  Cain is standing over him holding an ax in one hand
and his brother with the other.
Cain and Abel are labeled and for the most part appear as they did in the middle jamb.
Cain is still wearing a red robe (however a shorter 
ochre robe is now on top) and Abel in orange
or light brown.  The color and pattern of the stockings is consistent between the jambs.
It is odd, however, that their hair color has reversed; Abel now has brown hair and
Cain red hair.
	The right part of the right jamb shows Cain being marked by God.  God's forearm
protrudes from the upper left and is pointing directly at Cain.  Cain is seen in profile
facing towards the center.  There is a blue band surrounding the arm of God.  The bottom
part of the painting is obliterated, however, some writing is apparent.  
.subsec The Lower Panel
	The lower panel presents the Nativity Cycle, unfortunately much of it has been
destroyed.  The leftmost part is illegible.  Next, we can see Mary and Elizabeth hugging
each other under a pillared arch.  Both have gold halos and their names are clearly
written next to them.  Next we can see part of a scene with Mary sleeping on a blue couch.
She has a gold halo, is wearing a light brown robe with white on top.  Her left palm is
facing directly out.  Her head is resting on a cushion with a pattern that is identical
to the pattern of the cushion that Christ sits on.  It is red with a black diamond-shaped
grid with white spots at the intersections of the black lines.  The next part is obliterated
and only an ox's head in the upper corner can be seen.  Next we can see Joseph with a blue
halo and his name next to him.  His right arm is on his check and his head is tilted to his
right.  The next three scenes are in bad condition.  A boy with a horn,
an angle flying, two people close to each other, a pillar, a woman and two more people
can be made out.
According to the museum label the scenes of the bottom panel are visitation,
nativity, angel appearing to the shepards, and adoration of the magi.  
	Byzantine style
is apparent through out the mural, however, the bottom panel provides the strongest evidence of
eastern influence.  Western traditions would not depict the warmth of the embrace between
Mary and Elizabeth or portray Mary on a couch with her knees up.
.subsec The Dividing Bands
	The upper and middle panels are separated by a geometrical band, that is strongly
reminiscent of bands on Greek vases.  The band is orange or brown and blue on a black
background.  It is a meandering line that reminds one of a maze.  The illusion of depth
is very strong, indicating that the artist knew enough about perspective to create an
illusion of depth when he desired.  
	The band separating the middle and bottom panels looks like a twisted ribbon.  It
was painted with the same colors as the other band, also on a black background.  The white
flower-like design that we saw earlier on Christ's robe and at the end of the fans above
the left and right windows can be seen above and below each twist in the ribbon.
.sec Discussion
	When one sits in the chapel, one of the many images in front of the viewer 
dominates one's
perceptions, namely the image of Christ.  He seems to float directly above, his eyes
stare directly down on us.  The wings and eyes of the evangelists seem to direct 
attention towards Christ's head.
He is much larger than any other image, and his colors
seem stronger and brighter.  This intense, dominating image must have functioned very
well as an object of devotion, prayer, and meditation.
	To a worshipper well versed in the Bible, the
upper panel's depiction of the day of judgement must have been a strong reminder.  Seeing
the panel must have made Revelations seem even more real to the devout.  
Of course, the artist was for
the most part following the traditions of the past several hundred years of depicting
Christ in Majesty surrounded by the evangelistic symbols.  Still, the devotion inspired
by such images was probably not weakened by lack of originality.
	Aside from the religious and educational function (which presumably was the
primary function of the mural) the mural is aesthetically well designed.  The balance,
the symmetry and the use of colors were expertly handled.  The color is especially
impressive considering the limited palette the artist worked with.  The Romanesque
interest in the relation of parts and wholes is apparent.
The construction
of groups, and groups of groups was consistent and added to the harmony of the whole.
For example, the correspondences between the winged lion and the winged bull, or the
pairing of the apostles and the subsequent grouping into the four in the center and
the divided group of eight on the sides all give the work a coherence.  Another source
of coherence is the repeating of the same image faithfully in different contexts, for
example, the stars in the upper panel and the window jambs, or the white flower pattern
on Christ's robe, the window canopies, and next to the twisted ribbon on the dividing band.
	Reading the appropriate sections of Revelations I found explanations for
a couple features that were not mentioned in the literature.  The first is a speculation
for the reason that the lion, bull, and eagle are all oriented away from Christ with
their heads turned all the way around to look at Christ.  Revelations, Chapter 4, Verse 6,
states,  "... [there] 
were four beasts full of eyes before and behind."  While the representation
of the animals and people in the mural is far from realistic, it is nonetheless a style that
one would expect it to be 
inappropriate to distort reality the extent that would be necessary to literally depict
that verse of Revelations.  A reasonable loose interpretation of that verse would be
to have the animals faced "before" and turned around to see "behind."  This is exactly
what the artist of the mural did.  A loose interpretation would also account for
the fact that the animals have only two wings rather than the six called for in Revelations.
Please understand that I am not claiming that the artist of the fresco necessarily made
these interpretations, more likely he was following traditions that perhaps were based
on similar reasoning.
	The other feature of the mural that reading Revelations gives one
a better understanding of
is the so-called aureole about Christ.  I wonder if it served another function, namely
portraying the third verse, "... and there was a rainbow around the throne."  As I 
mentioned earlier the limitations of the artist's palette may account for its lack of
realism.
	In the process of analyzing the fresco, I observed a few mysteries that I found
no mention of in the MFA Bulletin's description.  The oddest one is the name of Cain
next to Abel.  Another is the pattern of alternating halo color of the apostles that
holds for all but one of the apostles.  Another anomaly is the exception in the otherwise
careful correspondence between the images of Cain and Abel in the center jamb and their
images in the right jamb.  All their features carry across between the jambs except their hair
color which definitely switches.
	The artist of the fresco worked under many constraints.  He had to follow closely
the established traditions for painting the main apse of a church and
of depicting the scenes that he did.
He presumably also wanted to depict as clearly and accurately as was
feasible the episodes from the Bible upon which his images were based.  He worked with
a very limited palette of colors.  While the normal time constraints of painting upon
wet plaster did not apply in this case, he nonetheless maintained the simple
direct style of true frescos.  Above all he was trying to create an image to serve the
religious purposes of creating an environment for the worshippers to pray and meditate.
Considering the restraints the artist functioned under, the Catalonian fresco is an
excellent work of art.

	[fb]To the grader:[fr]  I apologize that I did not have the time to do the
research that should have been done to relate this work to other works and the history
of the period in which it was created.  I am a graduate student with doctoral exams in a few
weeks and probably shouldn't even have spent the time I did.  Also, I know that I missed the
mid-term exam and its make-up but that could not have easily been avoided.
