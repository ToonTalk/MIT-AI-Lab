I will describe my doctoral thesis computer system that creates simple computer animation in
response to high-level, vague, and incomplete descriptions of films.
It makes its films by collecting and evaluating suggestions from several different bodies of
knowledge.
The order in which it makes its choices is influenced by the focus of the film.
Difficult choices are postponed to be resumed when more of the film has been determined.
The system was implemented in an object-oriented language based upon computational entities
called "actors".
The goal behind the construction of the system is
that, whenever faced with a choice, it sensibly choose between
alternatives based upon the description of the film and as much general knowledge as possible.
The system is presented as a computational model of creativity and aesthetics.

Director is a programming language designed for dynamic graphics, artificial intelligence,
and naive users.  It is based upon the actor or object oriented approach to
programming and resembles Act 1 and SmallTalk.  Director extends MacLisp by adding
a small set of primitive actors and the ability to create new ones.  Its graphical features
include an interface to the TV turtle, pseudo-parallelism, many animation primitives, and
a primitive actor for making and recording "movies".  
For high-level programming
Director provides a pattern-directed data base associated with each actor, an inheritance
hierarchy, a parts-whole hierarchy,
pseudo-parallelism, and a means of conveniently creating non-standard control
structures.  For use by relatively naive programmers Director is appropriate because of its
stress upon very powerful, yet conceptually simple primitives and its verbose, simple syntax
based upon pattern matching.
