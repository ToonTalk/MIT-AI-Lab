A framework is presented for making choices that are primarily constrained by aesthetic, as
opposed to pragmatic, considerations.
An example of the application of this framework is a computer system called "Ani",
capable of making simple computer animation in response to high-level incomplete story
descriptions.
Aesthetic choice is presented as a parallel computation in which
each italics("choice point") gathers together and evaluates italics(suggestions).
When faced with difficulties these choices can be italics(postponed).
The order in which inter-dependent choices are made is influenced by the
italics(focus) of the problem.
