.sec Introduction and Overview
	I hope to explore a computational view of aesthetics as exemplified by
a knowledge-based computer animation system.  The proposed system will have a
rudimentary aesthetic knowledge base, a knowledge base describing the display
procedures it has a available, and
procedures for using these data bases
to produce computer animated films.  The animation will be produced in an
actor-based animation language that I am developing concurrent with this research. [Kahn 1976]
While the main emphasis of this research
is to contribute to artificial intelligence, contributions to computer graphics
and to aesthetics are hoped for.  
To my knowledge there are no knowledge-based
graphics or animation systems
and very few based upon an actor model of computation.
.subsec My view of aesthetics
	Aesthetics is concerned with what makes a work of art
beautiful or good.<foot While some of things I will say may apply to music and other
non-visual arts, this scope of this paper is limited to the aesthetics of the visual arts.>
The system I plan to implement will be a working model of generative aesthetics.
The aesthetics knowledge that the system will possess is only a subset of that needed
for interpretive aesthetics.
My current view of aesthetics is that it can profitably be broken into the following
parts:
.begin narrow 5,5
1) Structural.  This part is concerned with the overall scheme, structure,
story or script.
I have
few ideas as to how to formalize what makes a story good or bad and intend
to leave this aspect to the user.
.break
2) Emotional.  This is where I see the system being the strongest.  The system will
know of the moods, feelings and personality that motions, shapes, colors, and their
interactions and transformations convey.
.break
3) Perceptual.  This is the part that is concerned with what looks pleasant or 
beautiful.  For example, flicker (i.e. alternating dark and light frames) for many
people is perceptually unpleasant.<foot This example, as are most of the ones in this
paper, is culturally dependent and can be considered correct only 
when all else is normal.  These assumptions could easily be overridden
since any of the other aesthetic aspects (structural, emotional and symbolic) or the
context may dominated.>
A more positive example is the observation that people, all else being equal, prefer
watching color films over their black and white equivalent.  This aspect also includes
more traditional aesthetic concerns such as composition and balance.  For the most part,
it is the handling of global interactions of aspects such as the color or shape of 
each object that determines the perceptual aesthetic.
.break
4) Symbolic.  The symbolic 
aspect of a work of art depends upon a cultural set of associations
between what an image depicts and other concepts.  I plan to investigate this aspect the
least since it requires too much real world knowledge to be imbedded into the system.
.end
.subsec The kinds of animation I expect the system to produce
	I intend to limit the kinds of animation that the system will produce (at least
initially) to narrative, non-representational object oriented films.  That is the system
will not know anything about the appearance of real-world objects, such as trees, faces,
etc., but instead will be limited to using only more abstract geometrical objects, such
as circles, blobs, triangles, spirals, etc..  This limitation is to avoid the need to
imbed in the system tremendous amounts of knowledge about objects such as eyes which
the system would need to know how they move, vary,
express emotions, and are combined with the rest of a face.  Perhaps this limitation
will prove unnecessary and be removed.
The restriction to [fi]object[fr] oriented animation
may or may not be a real restriction depending on whether the system will be able to
produce other types of films dealing with textures or colors for example.  It may be
able to by creating a film with only one object, that is a rectangle the size of the
screen and then manipulate its properties to produce non object-oriented films.  My
current thinking leans towards narrative animation, because a "story" gives the system
a lot of structure to work within.  The words "story" and "narrative" should be 
interpreted in the most general sense of the words.  I do not plan to get involved
in the problems of having the system understand stories in a natural language.
Most likely the scripts 
will be either a small set of assertions in a stylized, restricted
format or a short program.
.subsec How I hope to go about this
	I plan to attack the problem of creating a system capable of producing a wide
variety of such films in response to simple stories
by breaking it up into speed, path, size, shape, color and texture of objects,
debug each part independently and then worry about the interactions. 
Initially, I intend to concentrate on the first two aspects.
Eric Martin, an animator,
has emphasized the dynamics of animation in statements like, "Animation displays
process" and "movement has as much integrity as drawing".  He gives class exercises
of producing a film with only one small dot that does not change color or shape or size.
It is very instructive to see how much can be expressed this way.  The dot's 
character can be conveyed as happy, burdened, neurotic, frightened or whatever.  Certain
areas of the space can be characterized simply by the way the dot behaves.  If, 
for example, the dot
avoids an area, slowly approaches it and suddenly runs away, one tends to think of the
area as frightening or dangerous.  
	When single dot films are mastered, another dot (identical to the first)
can be added.  Very complex interactions corresponding to friendship, love, hate, fear,
dominance, rebellion, etc. can be portrayed.  For example, one might ask the system
to produce a dot movie of a neurotic dot (conveyed by erratic, jerky movements)
that comes across a
happy dot (which moves rhythmically in smooth curves with a gentle velocity) 
and after initial trepidation on
both their parts, they slowly merge.  The resulting dot is happy but after a while the 
neurotic personality takes over. 
	Color could be added to the dots to help give them character.  The happy dot
might have a bright red color, the neurotic one might be a dark green color
(or better still,
change color occasionally).  In same way that I can make dot movies where the motion
I concentrate on the motion in order to debug my handling and understanding of it, I
plan to also make color movies.  The problem would be to see what can be conveyed when
limited to changing the color of a few uniformly colored regions.
	Shape could also be used to enhance the characterization.  Round objects are
friendlier than pointed ones, irregular objects stand out more (i.e. have more character)
than symmetric ones.  (Of course, context can influence this, a square among blobs is
an oddball).  Shape films could also be explored where a shape could suddenly or
gradually (using interpolation routines) change into another.
.subsec Interactions and conflicts
	The next problem is the interactions of the various aspects of the film.  A slow
rhythm might have been chosen for a section of the film to emphasize the seriousness of
the section and yet a character's energetic impulsive dynamics might conflict.  Various
solutions are possible, if, for example, 
there are other characters they might be used to
retain as much as possible of the mood of the slow rhythm and the contrast might even
enhance the energetic character's personality.  If the slow rhythm is considered 
important enough, 
the character's motions could still be put into synchronization with the rhythm.
Suppose the desired rhythm is simply a three second beat, then the character's motions
might be modified to be small multiple, e.g. a 1 or 1.5 second beat.
	Other kinds of conflicts are possible.  The motion of an object may be so
over bearing as to wash out any desired effects of the colors.  In such situations
maybe the motion clues should be underplayed or the color changes exaggerated.  
Conflicts can arise because two rather similar motions are being used to convey
different personalities.  In such cases the differences between the motions usually
need to be increased.  This could be done in either of two ways.  Either a difference
description is generated and each motion is modified to widen that gap.  For example,
wild joyfulness might call for fast, curvy, irregular motion and neurosis might call
for fast, straight, irregular motion.  If both these conditions need to be conveyed
simultaneously (for different individuals) then their difference, in this case
straight versus curvy,
would be exaggerated.  The other way such conflicts might be resolved is based on the
fact that there are often a few different ways of the portraying the same mood or
personality.  The choice between them could be partially based on the largest difference
between the two motions. (I know the examples are poor and
this stuff is not well thought out.)
.subsec How the system will achieve effects
	The system needs to know at least one way to achieve each effect it may 
want to achieve. 
The descriptions of the means of accomplishing desired effects must be
manipulable in many ways to facilitate the kinds of solutions to the interaction
problems just mentioned.  The means/effects descriptions should consist of
a small set of stereotypical actions,
each action itself should be described in such a manner that it may be easily modified.  
The system will need
to be able to exaggerate or down play any aspect of the action.  In many cases, it will
need to be able to impose a rhythm upon the stereotype, or to stretch or shorten the
length of the component actions of the stereotype.
	The system also needs some knowledge of how to implement the suggestions for
achieving a desired effect.  As a hypothetical example, lets suppose the 
system wants to create a character that is simple,
orderly, and dull.  Associated with each of those adjectives may be a short list of
suggestions.  Let us just consider the suggestions relating to shape.  Now objects
will have a list of properties, such as whether an object is closed or not, or the
number of sides it is composed of, 
what, if any, axes it is symmetric about, how sparse or busy it is, etc..
The suggestions for "orderly" might be that the object should be closed, be composed
of a small number of sides, symmetric (perhaps about both the x and y axis), etc..
Dull may suggest much the same thing with maybe the additional suggestions that the object
should be simple, that
none of its component lines cross, and that a good example of a dull object 
is a square.  Dull may also
suggest that the object not be very different from most of the other objects in the
film.  So at this point the system has a list of desired attributes of the object it
is about to create.  They may conflict or be redundant.  There may be other restraints
on the choice, such as the requirement that the
object contrast significantly with another object
which has already been determined to be say a pentagon. 
Another restriction may be that the system is
being asked to try to be original. This might mean it should
not make this decision as it did previously
(which of course it would have to remember having resolved a similar situation
earlier) or more simply
it may mean that suggested examples (such as "dull"'s suggestion to use a square)
be avoided if possible.
	Once the system has decided that it wants an object, it must find the code to
realize it.  Suppose it has decided it wants a closed, symmetrical, simple, four-sided
figure, then it will have to match the desired object against procedures that can draw
it.  In this case, "Poly" will match since it will be described as drawing closed,
symmetrical, n-sided objects.  Associated with "Poly" will be information as to how
to use it to achieve particular aims.  Among this information will be the advice that
states if you want a simple n-sided figure then call "Poly" with an angle equal to
360 divided by n.  
	The above example would indicate that each procedure that draws on the screen
will need to have machine-understandable 
specifications.  Hopefully such specifications will be
simple, a description of the kinds of objects it can draw and advice as to how to
use it to draw particular objects.  Since I intend to limit the system to simple
geometrical shapes and a few blobs and squiggles this should not be too complicated.
In addition to specifications for drawing procedures, it will
also need specifications of programs that transform, move, or manipulate objects.
This investigation into the representation and use of the knowledge about display
procedures is where I hope for significant contributions to computer graphics
techniques.  Currently, computer graphics is done without the machine having any
understanding of the procedures that it is executing.  The useful of this self
understanding is one thing I hope the system will demonstrate.
.subsec Global Constraints
	At any point in the decision-making process the system will have
to make many rather
arbitrary decisions.  Should it make this object red or orange, should this object
be a square or a hexagon, should this object follow this trajectory starting from the
left, right, top or bottom, should this object be medium or large sized?  Sometimes
the system will be unable to find any reason to choose one over the other.  Hopefully,
in such cases the choice will be inconsequential.
More often,
however, there will be more global considerations that will constrain the system's
choices.  For
various reasons, the system may have any of the following constraints to operate under:
.begin narrow 5,5
1) variety, that is the choice is restricted, if possible, to those alternatives
not already chosen for other objects.
.break
2) simplicity, this applies at all levels, the shape of the objects and
their interaction, the composition, the interactions between objects etc..  Many
theories place a very high value on simplicity or economy that produces complex
effects.
.break
3) originality, to the system that will mean both making decisions that are different
from past decisions and ignoring, if possible, specific suggestions or examples
when alternatives exist.
.break
4) film length, the choice of motions and interactions of objects will be influenced
by any constraints as to the desired running time of the film.
.break
5) rhythm, a desired rhythm will also influence the dynamics of the film.
.break
6) mood, a desired mood will affect the choice of all the parameters.
.break
7) contrast or lack therof, often it will be desirable to have an object stand out
from the others and once its characteristics are determined it places constraints on
the others.
.break
8) tension, often tension can be created by generating expectations by following some
rule, pattern, or stereotyped sequence and then at the appropriate moment breaking it.
.break
9) exaggeration or lack therof, if a scene is to be emphasized then the actions and
interactions need to be taken to extremes
.break
10) coherence, usually coherence of theme, style, mood, etc. gives the work a certain
maturity or sense of purposefulness.
.break
11) obviousness, often effects should be obvious, other times they should be 
subtle depending upon the audience, the desired affect, etc..
.end
.sec Control Structure
	The basic process the system will be engaged in is making a series of
decisions to refine or substantiate a structure initially given by the user.  The
choices the system makes are usually only partially
constrained by the kinds of considerations just
listed.  Even when the structure provided by the user is 
relatively specific the system is still left with basically arbitrary decisions such
as whether a particular object will 
be a hexagon or octagon, red or orange, or move slowly
or very slowly.
	One can imagine a whole range of strategies for ordering the refinements or
decisions the system will make.  
The system could operate in a top-down, breadth-first 
fashion, refining on each pass
only that which is necessary.  The advantage here is that coherence will be greater.
The other extreme, a depth-first exploration would correspond to refining
one branch down to the level of object specifications and then expanding the next
branch with the recently added constraints.  The problem with
this approach is that the elements defined earlier will tend to be arbitrary while the
later ones might be too constrained, even to the extent that back-up is necessary.
	My current tendency is towards the former approach where decisions are made
only when necessary.  With either approach there remain many ordering decisions.  
Should certain aspects be developed first, such as motion and size, and only after
they have been developed the other aspects such as shape, color and texture
be expanded?  Should one character be developed completely
first based on some ordering of the aspects
and then the others expanded.
Or should all the characters' motion be decided simultaneously (or nearly so), and
then their size, then their shape, etc.?  Should the order vary depending upon the
structure constructed so far?  
	It is not even clear if one should think of the space of aspects of the objects
as an and/or tree.  
Sometimes the decisions can be fit into a tree.  For example, in deciding the
color of some friendly object the first node might be whether the color will remain
constant or vary.  Suppose that constant color is chosen, then the problem may no longer be
well described by a tree.  The system will then need to construct a set of features of the
color, for example, its brightness, its position on a scale of cold to warm, its
naturalness, etc..  The set of features that need to be determined might be provided by the
position in the tree, but the tree structure may prove to be too restricting.  The system
may want to postpone certain decisions and yet explore the nodes below it on the tree.
	This searching through a large space may remind one of earlier artificial
intelligence programs.  Decision trees were constructed and search heuristics applied
to solve problems.  The paradigm has subsequently shifted from search-oriented systems
to knowledge-oriented systems.  Why then am I describing the problem as one of searching
through a very large space of possible shapes, colors, sizes, and motions for an object
rather than knowing what to do?  But with aesthetics there are no very well-defined
goals but there are many possible "solutions."  Knowledge of all sorts is being used
to make these decisions but the choices are still under-constrained.  The best 
methodology that I can think of in such cases is to make those decisions first
that are the
easiest, the most constrained, or the ones most likely to provide reasonable constraints
for the rest of the decision process.  It is hoped that there will be little interaction
between the more specific decisions, so that the color of a friendly object can be chosen
without regard to its size.  The coherence of the object will be the result of the
more global constraints and choices. 
The size and color, for example, of an object need only be based on considerations
such as that the object is intended to be friendly, undistinguished, that the predominating
colors in the film be blues and greens, and that the screen is never to get very cluttered.  
The determination of the size,
however, need not be based on the color and conversely, so that interactions of the low
level aspects can be avoided.
.sec "Numbers, both Real and Random"
	This may be a minor or incidental point but I hope to avoid as much as possible
using number, both random ones and garden variety ones.  My objections against numbers
are partly phenomenlogical, that is they don't feel right; and partly computational, 
that is much economy can be gained by restricting the system to the following "numbers":
"a very little bit", "a little bit", "a little", "a medium amount", "a lot", "an awful
lot".  These "numbers" would be used in the descriptions of motions, sizes, distances,
and intensities.  The advantages of such numbers is that they make comparisons easier,
permit assertions to be made about the numbers themselves (such as consistently using 
the number "an awful lot" will result in a wild, confusing film), enable crude 
cross-aspect comparisons (hopefully "a little bit" of motion will "correspond" to
"a little bit" of size), and ease the task of making decisions relative to the context
("a lot" of size may correspond to a smaller number if all the other objects
are small or if the entire screen is small).
Of course, at some stage these numbers will need to be converted to ordinary numbers
and relatively simple procedures could accomplish this.
	My objections against random numbers are based on a belief that good art is 
not arbitrary, but the product of thought.
One 
reason I dislike random numbers to produce art 
is that to my knowledge the only other attempts to
create picture generating systems relied heavily on random number generators.
Good art is carefully constructed and thought out, usually each element is there for
a reason.  A random number generator is as likely to produce a "Mona Lisa" as are
a million monkeys to type "Hamlet".  This is not to say
that there are not inconsequential decisions that have to be made that could just as
well be made by the toss of a coin.  In such cases, however, one can just as easily
ignore the random number generator and produce as good a film.  Also, I am not saying
that there is no place for noise in art.  A slightly perturbed square may in some cases
be more desirable than a perfectly drawn square.  Some very useful texture patterns
are basically different noise levels.  A drunkard's walk may be disturbed by random
perturbations.  These uses of randomness, however, are very controlled.  A drunk does
not walk forward a random amount, then right or left some random angle, and then repeat.
There is a basic pattern that
is disturbed but not destroyed by randomness.  If, as in the earlier example,
the slightly perturbed square is
desired then there must be a reason, perhaps to make it look more like a square drawn
by a human in a hurry.  Again in such cases, the random perturbations must be very
controlled.  Any reliance upon randomness would make it much more difficult to demonstrate
and test the usefulness of the knowledge in system.
.sec The Structuring of the Space of Each Aspect of an Object
	When the system is determining the speed, path, shape, color and texture
of each object, its task would be greatly simplified if each aspect were properly 
structured.
  Intuitive spaces are desirable, so are standardized ones.  The way the
space is structured or described greatly influences the ease of maneuvering and 
reasoning within it.
.subsec Size
	Size is the easiest aspect to structure.  It can be standardized by using
something like the greatest inscribed circle, the least circumscribed circle or their
average.  This way a square of size "a lot" will be roughly the same as a line
of size "a lot".  This approach contrasts with the way the size of an object is usually
controlled in computer graphics.  A description of an object is given in terms of its
coordinates or as horizontal and vertical changes from the last position of a "pen".
This object can then be scaled.  A 
standard turtle procedure for drawing,
say polygons, is one which one controls not the absolute size but only the length of
each side.  Neither approach facilitates inter-object size comparisons and so is
inadequate for this task.
.subsec Speed
	Here I could borrow from physics and characterize the motion of an object
during a scene by its velocity and acceleration.  Were I to adhere even more strongly
to mechanics I would merge speed with path and deal only in velocity vectors.  This
does not, however, match the way I conceptualize the motion.  Often the speed and path
need to be modified separately (the path may be right, but the speed too slow,
for example).  Perhaps since the speed will often change in complex ways 
as a function of time.  It may also be important to quantize speed and acceleration so
that motion descriptions do not become too complex.
.subsec Path
	Here there are two problems combined; what the position of an object is
and what course it will take.  The position of an object in a standard turtle program
is not too easy to control, all one really has is control over where the turtle starts.
I expect to use some rule of thumb such as consider the position of an object as a
point that corresponds to the "center of mass" of the object.  The "center of mass" can
easily be approximated by the average position of all the vertices of the object.  This
makes it easy to center one object inside another, to have one object circle another, etc..
Other special points need to be associated with objects, such as a point which an object
grows or turns about.  Center of mass provides a convenient default.
	The course or path of the center of the object could be characterized as a
two dimensional cartesian space or as a list of turtle commands.  While I may use the
latter I think a richer more structured, more intuitive space is needed.  A path can be
characterized as either smooth or jagged, long or short, closed or not, symmetrical or
asymmetrical, etc..
.subsec Shape
	I hope that shape and path can share the same descriptive structures.
.subsec Color
	From what little I've read it seems that an intensity-hue-saturation space for
color is more intuitive and closer to our perceptual mechanism (for example, linear
interpolation between colors appears more linear)
than a red-green-blue space.  It is difficult to think of colors in terms of how much
red, green or blue they have.  It is usually easier to think of a color as being so
bright or intense, as being so saturated (i.e. how much white is in the color), and its
hue.
.subsec Texture
	The textures I plan to have available to the system are few.  One kind would
simply be different noise levels.  Another would be repeated shapes or simple patterns
such as turn on every other point, or every other horizontal line.  Certain aspects
can be characterized such as a texture's intensity (the percentage of points turned on
in the area), its orientation, its density (i.e. the distance between elements relative
to their size) or its complexity.  Part of the characterization of a texture built 
by the repetition of a shape would be the characterization of the shape itself.

.subsec Other aspects of objects
	There are other aspects of objects that I have not mentioned.  Orientation
and rotation are important and probably are similar to position and speed.  The line
that is used to delineate an object can also be controlled for various effects.  The
line can have varying width or color.  It can be smoothed. (Although the process of
"de-jagging" that uses the 
colors between the line color and background color to make the lines look smoother
is too wasteful
of colors to be useful with available hardware.)  Dotted and dashed lines are also possible.
.sec Expectations of the viewer
	Playing with the viewer's expectations is important.  Little is worse than a
very predictable film.  Good films create expectations, stretch them, break them at
crucial moments or satisfy them in unexpected ways.  Expectations create a point of
focus that can be used to the filmmaker's end.  Many of the expectations are
dependent upon the sophistication and idiosyncrasies of the viewer.
Whether the system will be
capable of playing with expectations or this difficult task will be left to the user who
created the initial structure is a question that requires more thought.
.sec Evaluation 
	There are at least two different aspects of this research that entail tricky
questions of evaluation.  The first is whether the films the system produces are any
good and connect in some way to the initial structure that inspired them.  The other
is concerned with how the system should be evaluated as a contribution to AI, computer
graphics or aesthetics regardless of the quality of the films.
.subsec Evaluation of generated films
	Originally I conceived of the task of the system as the generation of films
that, in addition to being good, followed the script accurately.  Two different
experiments could then be used to test this accuracy.  One would be to have the
viewers describe the film without knowing what its intention was and then comparing
the viewers' descriptions with the original script.  The other would be to tell the
script, show the film, and then ask for criticism.  I still plan to carry out these
experiments, however I don't think they are crucial to the evaluation of the films.
The feedback from the viewers will hopefully be very useful.  If the responses to
a group of films is positive, consistent but not what was intended then presumably
the system could be modified to produce those kinds of films when the effect they
created is desired and to try something else to produce the kind of film it originally
intended.  It should be kept in mind, however, that
the system's main goal is to produce [fi]good[fr] films, not simply films that
match the script.
	But how are we to know if the films are any good?  Some very sufficient but
unnecessary criteria would be, winning an academy award, getting rave reviews from
critics, or being a great box office hit.  A more likely criterion would be to
receive favorable criticism from "experts", in particular, human animators.  Failing
this the evaluation can fall upon the reader.  The thesis is the point, the films
only the product.  The reader of the thesis is constantly evaluating the research
and is likely to consider him or herself enough of an expert to judge the films.
If all this fails there is still one leg of defense to stand on.  The system could
be an instantiation of a very good model of aesthetic generative behavior and due
to its limited knowledge produce lousy or childish films.  This argument should
be avoided since it depends upon faith on the readers' part that ignorance is its only
flaw.
.subsec Evaluation of the system itself
	Were the system to produce award-winning films, I would be very happy, however,
I would not consider that proof of the system's worth.  It might have produced the film in a
very [fi]ad hoc[fr] and limited manner.  The quality of the
reasoning that the system uses to create the films is much more important than the
final product.  Additionally, I would hope that the system would at least remember
each major decision it makes and a justification for it.  I do not intend to build
any self-explanation abilities into the system, but it will remember in an accessible
form the information that such abilities would depend upon.
Despite my decision to limit
the expertise of the system to narrative, object-oriented, non-representational films,
I would also expect the system to be rather versatile.  It should be able to respond
to a wide variety of scripts.  It should be able to re-do a film with additional
constraints. (Such as "make the film a little bit more sedate and calm" or "make it
shorter and lighter".)
	Even in the case that the films it produces are lousy, it would not constitute
proof that the system is lousy.  The system might be based on very sound and general
principles, its reasoning may be very clear, it may be very versatile, and still
produce dull, ugly, or silly films.  If this were the case and it seemed plausible
that its flaws were in the content of its data base, which was 
either too limited or just 
plain incorrect, then the system could still be considered a success.  One should
remember that the primary purpose of implementing such a system is to demonstrate,
via a working example, a computational view of aesthetics.  To lessen the chance
that its knowledge base will be inadequate, however, 
I have been, and intend to continue,
becoming an expert, i.e. an animator.  Towards
this end filmmaking is my minor, and I have made several films both in a conventional
manner and by computer.
	Another hard question is how to evaluate 
the construction of a working system in terms of possible 
contributions to artificial intelligence
it is likely to make.  What is the general applicability of a system designed to produce
a very limitted class of animation?
The problems of exploring a very large space with such poorly defined 
goals and
under constrained choices have been not been investigated in AI to my knowledge.  I claim
that it is an important cognitive activity that occurs in situations other than the one
discussed here, generating art.  Presumably living one's life is an example.  The goal's
are poorly defined, part of the problem is generating the goals (as is also probably the
case with art), and the choices that one has as what to do next are not sufficiently
constrained by the reality of the situation or one's goals.
	The following is a list of other ways in which this research [fi]might[fr] contribute
to AI:
.begin break narrow 5,5
1) by providing a computational definition of aesthetics.  While aesthetics is probably not as
important as other areas being explored by AI researchers such as understanding natural
language, it is an important consideration in research, design, programming and many other
endeavors.
2) by cataloging and structuring knowledge about aesthetics. This
is important in the same way that structuring the knowledge one has of natural language is.
.break
3) by representing and cataloging
adjectives (such as friendly, sharp, red, etc.).  While the use
the definitions of adjectives will be generative, hopefully the extension to definitions
useful for interpreting will not be much different.   
.break
4) by providing a better grip on what it means to be creative or original
.break
5) by testing Carl Hewitt's actor formalism on a big real problem.  The mapping of the objects
in my system into actors seems straightforward, 
and perhaps the experience will help answer
the question as to how useful actors really are.
.break
6) by providing a better grip on how to manipulate, exaggerate, negate or 
transform stereotypical descriptions.
.end
.sec Objections
	I am well aware that in committing myself to this research I am treading
dangerous waters.  Computer scientists typically feel that aesthetics, and especially
animation, have little to do with valid [fi]computer science[fr] research.
Many objections of a completely different sort 
are likely from the art world.  A computational view of aesthetics appears to be
at variance with commonly held views of art as intuitive, imaginative, unpredictable,
non rule-based, and requiring the creator to have soul, or innate talent.  I think
that an AI view of these problems would be very enlightening and should be made.
Hopefully a working system
will be very useful in meeting these kinds of objections and more.
.subsec Lack of perceptions
	The system will be perceptually limited to input from a key-board.  It
will be blind both to the world and its own films.  One may wonder how such a 
perceptually-limited system could be expected to produce visual art.  A partial answer
is that perception is a process of creating symbolic structures from external stimulus
and therefore the system needs only those symbolic structures and not a perceptual
mechanism.  Its knowledge base will, to a large extent, be a condensed and simplified
version of the structures that I have built up over the years as a perceiver.  There
are historical cases of great artists or musicians who became blind or deaf and yet
were able to continue producing great works of art or music.  Nonetheless, it is
quite useful to see what one has produced.  The system will maintain a symbolic
structure describing the film and its images as it creates them. This structure
will compensate for most of the perceptual deficiencies of the system.  This will
not completely compensate however, for there are many cases were the creator did
not notice some feature or interaction
until the product was created.  For example, one film I made
had a very complex shape growing and turning while simultaneously
the colors were changing
in subtle ways.  The color changes turned out to be too subtle -- I still have troubles
convincing people that they are really happening.  The only solution of the need for feedback
is to rely on a human observer, who gives perceptual criticisms.  The system would then only
need the ability to take such criticism into account, perhaps by exaggeration of the aspect
that became washed out and down playing the other components.
.subsec Everyone sees differently
Another objection
to the system is concerned with the perceptions of the viewer.  The objection is that
each individual perceives a film differently, so it becomes problematic as to
what model of the viewer the system should have.  Much of the knowledge of the system
consists of facts such as "red is friendly", "square is dull", "curving, smooth motion
is happy" etc..  These are culturally-dependent generalizations that occasionally
fail due to the viewer's idiosyncratic experiences and associations.  There are at least
two retorts to this objection.  One is that every film or work of art suffers from the
same problem and yet there is enough of a common ground of associations, perceptions,
and experiences for the work of art to communicate and affect its viewers.  It is this
common ground that the system's knowledge will be based.  The other answer to this 
objection is that 
it is not inconceivable to build idiosyncratic knowledge-based systems.
Each viewer could modify the knowledge base according to his or her own feelings and
associations and then let the system produce the film.  A knowledge based system
should be very
capable of conforming to each individual viewer's subjective individualistic
preferences and personality.
.subsec A generative theory of aesthetics is not an interpretive theory
	One may object that the 
proposed system will exemplify the process of generating art, and as such
has little to contribute to the process of interpreting, perceiving, enjoying, or
analyzing art.  This objection may well hold true, it remains to be seen.  It is more likely,
however, that
an understanding of generation will contribute greatly to understanding
perception.  Perhaps much of the knowledge base is used in a similar manner when
interpreting as when generating.  For example, the fact that "red is warm" may be used both
in generating "warm" objects and in interpreting red objects as "warm".  Maybe a 
similar mechanism to that which is used to generate coherent, rhythmical films
is used to perceive the same features.  Also the system will in some sense be able
to "interpret" the films it itself makes as organized along certain lines, as using
certain techniques, as conveying a particular mood, etc..
	Another defense of approaching the problem via generation rather than 
interpretation is that its easier and still answers many interesting questions about
both the representation of knowledge and aesthetics.  This research project is 
already very ambitious, to expect it to contribute to interpretation is unreasonable.
.subsec But it will be mechanical and predictable
	A common criticism of films or art is that 
they appear too mechanically constructed,
that they are too predictable.  
This is an especially common criticism of computer generated
films.  The motion is too smooth, it has little character.  
The shapes are too exact, they
too lack character.  The computer films that are exceptions to this are either driven by
pseudo-random number generators or by humans.  
The former are often structureless and lack
coherence since too many decisions were made by "tossing a coin".  The latter are often
fine since they avoid being mechanical by having humans graphically communicate the
motion or shape to the computer.
	My system will hopefully avoid this difficulty by a process 
similar to that which
the human goes through.  The motion it will give objects will typically have character
and complexity, unless of course it is trying to convey a certain mechanical personality
to an object.  Basic patterns of motion will be combined and modified to achieve a
very definite character which are not likely to be mistaken for mechanical motion.
	Some might complain that being deterministic the system will be too predictable.
It will be deterministic in the sense that, unless told to behave
differently, it will produce 
the same film for the same script.  The system, however, should
be able to remember the decisions it made in making the first film and, 
if so instructed, it
will try to make another that is significantly different from the first.  One may still
object that the system will still be predictable, if one asks for a warm object it turns
out red or orange, never black or blue.  The system should be able to inject an
unexpected or unpredictable element into a film without the use of random number generators.
It could establish a pattern and then break it at a critical point.  It could decide to use
one aspect of an object as an odd distinguishing feature.  For example, it might be a
very pleasant friendly object have a large pointed shape (presumably an unfriendly shape).
Here it would depend upon the motion, color, line, and texture to override the size and
shape.  If possible, the system will choose which feature or features to make anomalous for
a character on some positive basis not only because it is expected 
that the intended character portrayal
will not be weakened by the anomalous features.  As in the example of the large pointed
friendly object, the atypical size and shape for friendly objects may have been chosen
because the character was supposed to be a strong friendly ally of another object.  
One of the few well-defined goals of the system will be to have a good reason for every
choice it made.
.subsec "Its got no soul, no imagination, no feelings"
	Many would object that the system could not produce good art since it lacks
either soul, or imagination or emotions.  Soul is the hardest to contend with since
I don't really know what it is.  I expect the system will appear to have a rather
distinct personality as a filmmaker, but does that have anything to do with soul?
	Imagination is almost as tricky, the system will probably appear to be imaginative,
to come up with "creative" solutions to problems but some people demand more than
appearances.  Will it really be creative or simply doing what I told it?  I think the
question is kind of silly and hopefully it will do both.  There is another sense in
which the system is imaginative, that is that it will be imagining as best it can what
the film will look like as it makes it.
	Some people think that when an artist paints a depressing scene that he or she
must be feeling depressed while painting it.  It might indeed help to be feeling in a
particular mood to create a consistent and strong visual representation of it.  The
system need not "feel", however, to behave the same as people who do.  
.subsec Once you reduce it to a rule its no longer Art
	People who say this typically do not understand the computational complexities
of a procedural system using a knowledge base.  There is probably truth in this
objection if one thinks of a simple rule, or a few weakly interacting rules.  If the
process is too simple, too predictable, then indeed it is not likely to producing good
art.  The system I am proposing, however, will be based on a very large set of
"rules" that interact in complex ways.
.subsec Need to understand psychology too well
	It might be the case that in order to produce good art one needs a very good
understanding of human psychology.  One must understand what percepts affect people and
how, what creates
what kind of expectations etc..  The system will have some knowledge about this but it
is possible that it will be inadequate.  The system may be too ignorant to
function properly, then again may be not.  Much of the system's knowledge will be useful
facts and techniques that are based upon an empirical understanding of human psychology.
At this point I see no other way to resolve
the question of whether this will be sufficient
without actually attempting to build such a system.
.subsec Art is not well enough understood
	There are two senses of this objection that may be true.  One is that I don't
understand art well enough and must be an artist or study art for many years to even
attempt to form a theory of aesthetics.  I am trying to reduce this deficiency as best
I can, by reading, by making films, by going to art museums, by talking to animators, etc.
but it may be that this will prove inadequate.  It is common in AI, however, for researchers
who are not experts in language, medicine, electronics or perception to still try to
apply AI to those fields.
	A more serious problem would be that the other sense of this objection, that 
[fi]no one[fr]
knows enough about art, at least in an explicit form, to attempt such a project.  Many
people believe that the skill to produce art is not understood, some even venture to
claim that it is not capable of being understood.  If, however, I do manage to create
a convincing system then I would have made a contribution to the thesis that the knowledge
involved in producing and appreciating art is symbolic and not very different from the
other kinds of knowledge that people possess.
.subsec Good Art combines very many subtle aspects
	One interpretation of this objection reduces, once again, 
to the possibility that I don't (or can't)
know enough
to tell the system enough to perform adequately.  We'll see.
	It should be clear, however, that the system will be capable of subtle effects.
It might make the difference, in say color, between two objects very small, just barely
perceptible.  Or it may want to subtly create a schizophrenic character by down playing the
obvious schizophrenic behavior and by avoiding obvious techniques such as quickly changing
the shape or color of the character.  This last technique could still be used, only subtly
that is only slowly changing from one shape or color to another that is not very different.
.sec An Example
	I need to work through entire scenario, from original script, to first draft, to
feedback from human, to final version.  I haven't done it yet.

.sec Summing up
	A system has been proposed that I hope will contribute to AI, aesthetics, and
computer graphics.  The system will be based upon a computational view of generating art
that emphasizes the need to structure the necessary knowledge so that it can be used
in a very flexible manner and be easily modified and manipulated by the system.  The emphasis
will be on the facts, generalizations, rules, and procedures; what they are, how they
should be represented, how they should be organized, etc..  This is not to say that no
attention will be devoted to trying to discover very general and powerful principles
or to heuristics for searching through the very large decision space, only that I consider
the problem of getting the needed
knowledge into the system to be more important.  
	I keep seeing strong analogies between this research and research on natural
language understanding.  Linguists traditionally were interested primarily in the
syntax and generation of language.  They lacked a sufficiently powerful view of
computation to handle adequately problems of semantics and meaning.  When a computational
view was applied to language by AI researchers the emphasis shifted towards understanding
and interpretation of language.  Art historians and theoreticians have, for the most part,
studied the problems of interpretation and criticism of art.  They have failed, or more
commonly not even tried, to formalize the knowledge or discover the rules behind either
interpretation or generation of art.  Perhaps, in the same way that a computational view
of language has aided linguistics and furthered the state of artificial intelligence, a
computational view of aesthetics will aid in the understanding of art and artificial
intelligence.
