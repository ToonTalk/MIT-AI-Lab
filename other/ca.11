.sec Definitions
.subsec  What is a Computer
	A digital computer manipulates symbols in accordance with sets of 
instructions and procedures defined by a programmer.  These symbols can
represent numbers, words, relationships, or pictures when being used for computer
graphics or animation.  Internally these pictures can be represented in a large
variety of ways, for example, as a list of lines each one described by the
coordinates of the end points, or as a large array where each element of the array
describes the color or intensity of a point in the picture, or the pictures can
be represented internally at a higher level of abstraction as either procedures
to generate them, or as a formal description.  Combinations of these representations
are also sometimes useful.
	Externally the computer can communicate this internally represented picture
to a large number of display or drawing devices.  The most common devices are
plotters where a mechanical pen draws on paper, raster scan tvs which resemble normal
tvs, vector displays where each line is drawn in a cathode ray tube by controlling the
beam and micro film recorders where the beam is directed towards photographic film.
Each of these devices differs greatly in speed, accuracy, resolution and expense.
.subsec  What is Computer Animation
	Sometimes both the computer and output device are fast enough that a picture
can be generated and displayed in a small fraction of a second.  When this is done
on a tv display one can see computer animation as it is being made.  However, one
often wants to generate very complex pictures or is using a slower computer or
display and in that case one must record frame by frame each drawing onto film
to overcome the slowness of the device.  It should be remembered that computer
animation is some real sense independent of the medium of film.  Film is typically
used either to speed up the action, to record the action in order to distribute,
or to view it on a large screen.  Even though resolution
of film is presently much greater than video, computer images intended to be 
animated are typically video originally and therefore film can not add anything.
.subsubsec Demonstrative vs. Procedural
	There are rather different ways in which computer animation is created today.
One way is sometimes called "demonstrative" in which in some manner the user of the
system demonstrates to the computer what is desired.  The most common examples of this
are "key-frame systems" where the user sketches the "key" or pivital frames directly
into the computer using a digital tablet or pen with which the computer is connected
and able to observe and record the hand movements of the user.  The computer is then
instructed to manipulate that picture, typically to interpolate the last picture into
the new one.  Other manipulations are possible such as translation, rotation or the
addition of random noise.
	An equally common way of producing computer films is to describe procedures
for generating each frame
in some 
stylized language that the computer understands.  For example one might describe
a square as the following procedure: "REPEAT 4 [FORWARD SIZE] [RIGHT 90]" which
in English means "repeat the following four times: go forward the current value
of a variable called "size" and then turn right ninety degrees."  The convience
of a computer animation system such as this depends on  the 
appropriateness and simplicity
of the language one must describe ones pictures in and on the users familiarity with
programming.
.subsubsec Digital vs. Analog
	So far I have been discussing only digital computers and animation created
by them, but there are also
analog computer animation systems.  Analog circuitry that is very
fast but limited in flexibility is used.  These systems are more analogous to 
synthesizers of electronic music.  
.subsubsec Hybrids
	Some people recognize advantages to both digital and analog computer animation
and have created hybrid systems that intended to take advantage of both.  One such
system is at the University of Illinois' Circle Campus and is run by Sanden and De Fanti
(sp?).  Most systems are purely digital because most people are not willing to put up
with added complexity and the loss of control inherent in analog systems in return for
only an increase in speed.  Better control
is provided by simply filming a digital system, the major drawback being lack of
immediacy (since film takes a while to be processed).
	Another kind of hybrid computer animation that is being talked about these
days is a combination of demonstrative and procedural animation.  The idea is that
the user would use graphical input to describe the objects or their motion when
appropriate and 
use procedures when their power or exactness is desired.  MIT's Architecture
Machine Group is currently trying to create such a system.
.sec Procedural Computer Animation
	(this section describes animation done without the aid of graphical inputs,
solely be program generated images)
.subsec  Historical view
	Procedural computer animation began in the early 1960s, with Bell Labs being
among the pioneers.  Computer languages and software intended for other purposes were
extended to produce vector drawings on a cathode ray tube.  Typically objects were
defined by their coordinates in space, occasionally in a three dimensional space that
could be projected into a two dimension plane internally by the program.  Procedures
were defined to manipulate these objects by rotating, scaling, translating them 
typically using linear algebra.  The most common use of this type of computer animation
was in the production of instructional films.  Early films of this type included one 
that showed a communication satellite in orbit and another that displayed crystal growth.
	From the beginning computers were being used to produce films that 
took advantage
of some of the unique advantages they have in animation.  These films displayed 
something
that could not be filmed (being too small, far away, or whatever) and required too great
an amount of computation to be practical for conventional hand drawn animation.  These
are films that could not have been done using either analog or demonstrative mechanisms.
.subsec  Current State as exemplified by LOGO
	Procedural computer animation has evolved down a few different paths since the
early 1960s.  One pathtaken was to extend
the original conception of computer animation as the
manipulation of objects described by their coordinates or generating functions.
These systems can display projections of three dimensional objects hiding those
lines that would be obscured were the objects real solids.  Then the problems of 
realistic
shading and lighting were resolved, so that today there are systems that can generate
pictures that look very much like photographs of real objects.  Static reality was
one of the major goals of these researchers and little was done to provide good control
of the motion and transformations of these objects.  Typically the motion would be
defined mathematically.
The University of Utah
pioneered much of this research.
	The other major direction that computer graphics and animation research has gone
is towards designing system that are easier to use.  Special languages were designed 
that were simple, mnemonic, and yet powerful enough to do all that the previous systems
did.  Perhaps most importantly within these languages were imbedded concepts and ways
of thinking of graphics and animation that were much closer to how one originally
concieves of one's animation.  For example, instead of having to describe a triangle
in terms of its end points, these newer languages allowed one to give rather intuitive
instructions to a mechanical "pen".  The two best examples of such languages is
SmallTalk developed at Xerox Parc and Logo developed at MIT.  One reason for this
stress on simplicity and intuitiveness is because both language were originally intended
to be used by young school children.  Both projects are still active in teaching
children to use the computer to create music, drawings, animation, etc. however, it
soon became apparent that these languages were often the most convient way for computer
scientists to do computer graphics and animation.
Since I am more familiar
with Logo I will describe only it.
.subsubsec Turtles or how you draw things
	In Logo one draws by giving instructions to a computational entity called a
turtle.  One can tell the turtle to go forward any specified amount, to turn left or
right any amount.  These turtles will if they have their "pen down", leave a trail
as they move around the screen.  It turns out that turtles are a very good, intuitive
way to think about producing images on the screen.  Very simple, very clean, turtle
programs, often produce very impressive complex images (some of which illustrate this
article?)
.subsubsec Turtles or a good way to animate things
	Using Logo to animate one normally takes what are called "snapshots" of sections
of the display and these snapshots are subsequently displayed in rapid succession often
in different parts of the screen producing apparent motion.  However, in some more 
recent extentions of Logo (and even earlier with Smalltalk)
one is able to animate in a more
intuitive way.  Multiple turtles can be created with almost any appearance and can move
around the screen in any manner.  One ultimate goal along this line is to create
an animation system where the user is like a movie director who can easily 
specify what he or
she wants each "actor" to look like and how they behave.
.sec Demonstrative Computer Animation
As mentioned earlier the other major approach to computer animation is one which
one controls basically through graphical means.  One points with a light pen, or draws
on a digitized tablet which sends the current coordinates of a stylus to the computer
a large number of times a second.  Ivan Sutherland pioneered this method of communication
with a computer at MIT's Lincoln Lab in the early 1960s.  He was followed in the late
1960s by Ron Baecker, also at the Lincoln Lab, who concentrated on the problem of
[fi]animating[fr] images drawn into the computer.  A major innovation of his was a
technique for
graphical input of the path and speed of objects.
	These initial efforts lead to "key-frame" systems which added the capibility
of the computer producing "in-between" drawings between two drawings that were
graphically inputted into the machine.  This "in-betweening" is one of the most
tedious and time consuming aspects of conventional animation and it is hoped that
such systems will soon be of help to conventional (ie hand-drawing) animators.  Using 
these programs in odds ways can produce quite unusual transitions such as those in
Peter Foldes' film "Hunger".)
	The lastest direction these system are going is towards what are called
"paint brush" systems.  Up until recently when the computer drew a line or displayed
a line a user drew on a tablet the line was typically a thin single-toned line.  With
the creation of color raster scan systems 
foot<Barry this is what I showed you on the Advent>
sometimes called "frame
buffers", it is now possible to replace the "pen" with a "paint brush".  The user can
define the characteristics of the brush he or she wants--- its color, width, pattern
and "paints" on a color tv monitor.
New York Institute of Technology, MIT's Architecture Machine Group, and Xerox Parc
are among a few who are developing such systems.
.sec  The Future
	(this section is rather opinated and while optomistic that optomism is shared
by most computer scientists today)
.subsec  Hardware
	Computers have been getting cheaper, faster and more powerful every year.  If
current trends continue computers will within a ten years be cheap enough for nearly
anyone who wants to, to own one.  In addition, with faster computers and displays
the need to film the display in order to see one's animation will hopefully become
much rarer.  Also with faster and cheaper memory it becomes feasible to raise the
quality of the image and number of possible colors.
	Currently both computer and hand-made animation is too expensive and time
consuming to allow one to really explore.  It is rare that an animated film goes
thru many revisions as a result of producing "rough drafts" and then making improvements.
There is good reason to believe that when one is able to produce quality [fi]
interactive[fr] computer animation that the ease of modification and testing
will greatly increase the quality of these animations.
.subsec Digitized Live Action
	The computer is beginning to be used to process real images of the world.
These images get into the computer via a vidicon (tv) camera and an analog to digital
converter.  The programmer is then free to manipulate these images in a variety of ways.
This sort of animation is most analogous to roto-scoping where an animator bases each
drawing
frame by frame on live action footage.  Ken Knowlton and Lilian Schwartz both at Bell
Labs have produced computer films based on this technique.
.subsec Better Separation of each element of the Animation
	One unique property of the newer
computer animation is that each graphical element can
be manipulated independently.  A user of a paint brush or color Logo system can
draw an image and then without redrawing replace any of the colors with any others
instantaneously.  Similarly if one is happy with the color but not the shape one
can re-create the image with the same colors but with a new shape.  Similarly the
motion, change, texture, and size of any element of the drawing can be manipulated
independently of the others.  I see such systems as being very common and designed so 
that it is even easier to exploite this great advantage of computer in the
development and testing of animations
.subsec Smarter systems
	Another direction one could hope that animation will go is towards systems
that know a fair amount about animation and the elements being animated.  Recent
advances in Artificial Intelligence at MIT and elsewhere provide computational
mechanisms that could be used to create a system that is knowledgable enough about
animation to allow the user to interact with the computer at a more conceptual
level.  For example, the user might simply indicate that a particular character
should walk in a bouncy energetic manner over to another character.  Or if a more
abstract film is desired one might indicate that one wants a film centered around
a bright pulsating circle and the system will make guess as to what size it should
be, how fast it aught to pulsate (and what that means) what the background color
should be, etc.
.subsec Animation by Computer
	In the longer term there is reason to believe that some day the term
"computer animation" will become an ambiguous term.  It will mean either "animation
done on a computer" or "animation done by a computer".  The today either
the latter
does not exist or consists of films where nearly all the computer decisions were
based on a simulated flip of a coin.  The day when such decisions might be based on
a real understanding of perception and aesthetics may not be that far off.
