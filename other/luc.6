Conventional programming languages are inadequate for constructing reasoning systems
organized as communities of autonomous individuals.
They lack a means of conveniently describing the behavior of the individuals, the relationships
between individuals and subsocieties, and communication conventions and paths between
individuals and societies.

This paper presents the thesis that "actor" languages are ideal as an underlying base in the
implementation of societies.
The language "Director" is presented as an example of how one might represent individual
reasoning agents as actors and their interaction as "message passing".
Communication and control conventions are established between the actors to form composite
actors that correspond to subsocieties.
A lengthy example of an actor society implemented in this manner called "Ani" is presented.
Portions of the reasoning Ani does in creating an animated film are used as illustrations
of an actor-based society style of reasoning.
