1The Peanuts Animation System0
.sp
	The goal of this research is a computer system which
in response to an english description of a story 
creates an animated cartoon corresponding to that story.
Initially the characters of the story will be limited to
Schultz's Peanuts characters and rather simple activities.
The reasons for creating such a system are many and varied.
.sp
1) Educational---this could provide a different and
stimulating environment for children to learn to
express themselves well, to learn, in the role of a
director, about animation and film, to learn how
to criticize their own work in order to improve it,
and to get experience working on relatively long
term projects.
.sp
2) Artificial Intelligence---This system would be a
good domain to work on problems of real world knowledge,
common sense, and interactions of many different sources 
of knowledge such as, animation techniques, cartooning
techniques, the Peanuts characters and thier world,
real world knowledge, human emotions and how they
appear, and the story given by the user.
.sp
3) Entertainment---This may be the first time that
animation would be an active event in people's
activities as opposed to rather passive viewing.
.sp
4) Computer graphics and animation---It will be the
first time that a computer animation system knew
what it was doing.  The proposed system would know
what all the characters look like, how they move around,
and what it was drawing at all times.  It would also know
a good deal about animation and cartooning
techniques and that why it was using any particular one.
It would know about in-betweening, composition, perspective
dramatic effects such as anticipation and exaggeration,
and flow of motion.  (By "know" I mean that it would
use the knowledge when appropriate, in this case for
defaulting when not told otherwise about a decision,
for explanation of what it is doing and why (which is very
important from the educational point of view) and for
criticism (in the form of warnings) when something isn't
the way it thought it should be (e.g. not much action,
the center of interest is too close to the corner, etc..))

1My Own Background0
	In conventional animation---none.  I have read about
4 or 5 books on the subject (and many more about cartooning)
and have always enjoyed viewing it. However I can not draw
very well but am willing to learn. In film and TV---I
studied cinema for a year at the University of Stockholm
about 3 years ago.  Besides reading and viewing, I had alot
of practice with video as camera person, director, editor,
actor, etc..
	In computer graphics and animation---Four or five
years ago I was very involved in "computer art" using a plotter
and taught a non-credit course on the subject.  More recently
I been involved with LOGO at MIT and have done some work
on computer graphics and animation with fifth graders.  I am
presently involved in a project to design animation primitives
to ease the task of teaching children how to write animation
programs.
