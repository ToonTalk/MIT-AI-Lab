(LINE, etc)
and want to erase all of it.  EHL (Erase wHole Line) will do the trick.
EH2L erases the line you're on a__n__d__ the next.  What H does is go to
the beginning of the line you're on before doing anything else.

	Try EHF (Erase Hole File).  Do a G(et) before you lose all that
good Stuff, though.

	If you just say HL, nothing seems to happen.  This is because,
not only does H cause you to back up to the beginning of the line or
whatever, but after everything else is done, it puts the cursor back
where it started from.  This seems pretty useless.  However, if you
now type O(object) a few times, you will find yourself bouncing to and
fro between the ends of the new current object.  namely the Hole Line
you are on.(Saying HRL (Hole Right end of Line) gets you the left and
right ends of the same line, HL gets the left ends of two consecutive
lines.)  Thus without losing your place you can change the current object.

	Sometimes you want to change one word to another.  Mcatdog
(Make cat dog - the  is the ALT key) makes the next cat
into a dog.  DO BF and try doing MeE.

	The first e in the file is now E.

	Now try 2MeE.  The next two e's become E.  Now do F
to get to the end and do B2MeE.  The last two e's become E. 
Now try BF  and then *MeE.  The * acts like a very big
number, and so every e in the file becomes E.

	Go to some line with at least two or three t's on it.  (Make
one if necessary.)  Type HL to make this the current object.  Hit O a
few times to see what the object is.  Now do HMtT, and the
first t i_n_s_i_d_e_ t_h_e_ c_u_r_r_e_n_t_ o_b_j_e_c_t_ becomes T.  Try H*MtT.  All
(and only) the t's in that object are changed.  Nothing outside the
object is affected.  Thus Hole when used with Make confines Make's
attention to the current object.

	So if you see the word Peter appearing several times in a
group of 5 lines, say, and you want to make it Paul, go to the first
line, say H5L (Hole 5 Lines), hit O to check the object. then do
H*MPeterPaul.

	You should now be ready to do all this to files you want to
keep around.  The idea is to VISIT the place you want to keep stuff,
and insert it there.  Thus if you say VJEFFY (Visit Jeffy),
everything you insert there will be remembered.  If you then visit
someone else, and then visit JEFFY again, you will find all the stuff
that was there when you last left JEFFY.

	If you visit DIR, you will find a list of everything
you can visit that already has something in it.

	You can always visit new places.  Not surprisingly, you won't
find anything there.  It is exactly like visiting a new notepad.
Whatever you put in it gets remembered for later visits.


	If you want to back up to an older version simply Erase wHole
File. It will back up to an earlier version and ask you what you want
to do with it.  If you want to keep backing up then delete it and
the process will be repeated until there are no further files left.
If you arrive at a file that you want, just say keep.

	When you see the screen flashing, try to find out why.
1.  Your file may be in the process of being saved
2.  You can be going into Alter Mode or Insert Mode
3.  If screen continuously flashes something is wrong.  Tell
    Prof. Pratt what you did, so that he can correct it.

	V_i_s_i_t_i_n_g_
	Here are the basic facts about visiting.
1.  If visiting one of your own files, it will be "saved" for you
every 300 characters you type, and whenever you visit another file or
exit from DOC.


2.  If your file has only one name, DOC gives it a second name, its
v_e_r_s_i_o_n_ n_u_m_b_e_r_.  Each time DOC saves your file it saves it with a
version number one greater than last time it saved.  DOC only allows
four versions to be around, purging the oldest first when there are
more than four.

	If you erase the whole file (EHF), DOC will immediately give
you back the last version you saved, and ask you whether you want to
keep or delete it.  This is one way to go back to an old version.
Another less destructive way is simply to visit the old version you
want, by giving the name a_n_d_ version number, rescuing what you want
from it and then returning to the up-to-date version, which is the
version you get when you don't give a version number.

	If you want to zap all the out-dated versions of a file, visit
DIR (your directory), move the cursor to somewhere on a line
containing one of the files to be zapped, and say Z.

	If you are visiting a two-name file, only one old version is
saved.  Thus two-name files can be sudden death if you suddenly have
to go back to an earlier version.

3.  You can visit other people's files, by giving their a_d_d_r_e_s_s_
(addresses are always followed by ;), but any changes you make to them
will be undone when you leave.  (That is, DOC simply doesn't save
other people's files on your behalf.)  If you want to work on someone
else's file, make your own copy by visiting it, saying DHF (dump whole
file), visiting a cle
